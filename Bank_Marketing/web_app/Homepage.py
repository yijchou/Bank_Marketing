# st.write(""" The **Bank Marketing Campaign Dataset** that originates from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**
# is a dataset used for analyzing and modeling marketing strategies. This dataset is derived from direct marketing
# campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls,
# often with the aim of promoting a term deposit product. The dataset includes a wide range of inputs such as age,
# job, marital status, education level, default history, housing and personal loan status, and so on. """)
